        PoliNetwork is committed to providing a safe and collaborative environment for
        its users. In order to maintain this high standard, PoliNetwork
        has developed a set of rules that users are required to
        respect.
        <div style="padding-top: 10px"></div>
        These rules are designed to ensure mutual respect,
        the protection of privacy and the rights of other users, and to avoid
        any form of abuse or harmful behaviour.
        <div style="padding-top: 10px"></div>
        Adherence to these rules is critical to creating an environment
        positive and respectful, and for all users to enjoy
        full of the experience offered by PoliNetwork. For this reason,
        we invite all users to consult the rules in detail, and ad
        make sure you comply with them at all times.
