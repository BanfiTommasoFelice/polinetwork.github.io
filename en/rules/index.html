<h3>
Section 1: CONTENT AND MEASURES
</h3>
<p>
Definitions:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> Internal person is one who has been in the group for a reasonable time and is part of the group in which he is (if he is in third tier of management engineering, then he really attends the third tier of management engineering).
   <li> An external person is a person who has just joined the group or who does not attend the reality of the group.
   <li> Recognized Association and Representative List identified in reference to the University Register
   <li> Downgrading: principle of hierarchical descent in the roles of the Network due to serious events: who was delegate of the Network becomes simple Admin Advisor, who was Admin Advisor becomes simple Admin, who was Simple Admin becomes normal user, normal users are muted or banned.
</ul>
<h3>
Rules:
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> 01. External spam, i.e. not coming from a group participant (one person enters and spam) is not tolerated. Those who do this will be banned from the entire Network.
   <li> 02. Peer dialogue (internal people) should be encouraged and not minimized.
   <li> 03. Internal spam, on the other hand, is tolerated if it does not become invasive (if everyone starts spamming, you have to discourage, but usually does not happen). Internal spam consists of:
       Members from the echelon who send thesis surveys;
       A link they find interesting about a project.
   <li> 04. We must remember that the groups are Users: it is always preferable, if you see a problem (offensive discussions, heavy teasing ...), try to solve it in words (checking the contact according to the current privacy legislation, in case of repeated behavior you will be banned).
   <li> 05. Representatives on the programme boards (CCS) can unanimously use the groups of the Network of their course of study to ask to send communications, as well as every institution of the Politecnico di Milano (School, Presidents of the Degree Course Council etc ...) who ask us. The Network reserves the possibility, if it finds that the message is not appropriate (useful for students, directly or indirectly), to not accept the publication of the message.
   <li> 06. The President of the Student Council is allowed to propose to send communications in all the groups of the Network, subject to agreement with the Admin Council to determine the methods of dissemination.
   <li> 07. Associations recognized by the Politecnico di Milano have the right to ask to send promotional messages to the groups they belong to. The association directly consults the chief admin or the delegate for external communication who will ask the chief admins concerned, the chief admin notifies the Council via the bot:
    <ul>
       <li> approval of the message and the message itself; </li>
       <li> the name of the association; </li>
       <li> the type [promotional message, invitation to an event, information message, others (specify)]; </li>
       <li> which groups it will be sent to. </li>
   </ul>
   Once the communication has been made, a period begins in which each Head Admin, Delegate or Guarantor can express a veto:
   <ul>
   <li> If the veto arrives WITHIN 4 hours after the notification is sent to the Council, the message is not authorized and a poll is created to authorize the sending of the message </li>
   <li> After 4 hours, if no vetoes have been vetoed, the association is allowed to send </li>
   <li> If from 4 to 48h the Council vetoes a vote will be started to determine if the message has the approval of the majority of the Council. If the vote is negative, for the next 3 months each message from the association must be approved individually by the Council with a 48-hour survey before sending and additional actions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. </li>
   </ul>
   To avoid abuse, the 4 hours run only from 09:00 to 22:00 (eg. If a request reaches the Council at 21:00, the 4 hours expire at 12:00). <br>
   
   It is not possible to send multiple messages if they are not separated by a reasonable number of messages, indicatively
   <ul>
     <li> 30 for groups from 1 to 100 users </li>
     <li> 50 for groups of 100 to 2000 users </li>
     <li> no limit for 2000+ user groups. </li>
   </ul>
   The time factor is also very important not to give the impression that the group has become something where spam occurs frequently, we do not give you a precise limit but a reasonable choice could be 1/3 weeks between each sponsored message (generic), depending on the group.
   It is the responsibility of the head admin to ensure that these limits are not exceeded except by voting in the Council. <br>
   
   In the event that a head admin is not appointed, his function is carried out by the delegate for internal communication.
   <br>
   In the case of a departmental club or an unrecognized association, the procedure is as follows:
   <ul>
     <li> An unrecognized departmental club / assoc applies for one or more courses. </li>
     <li> Requires unanimous approval of student representatives in ccs in each of the courses. </li>
     <li> If successful, the club will have permission to request the network to send messages in approved groups. </li>
     <li> Then the same procedure is followed as for recognized associations </li>
   </ul>
  <li> 08. The Associations recognized by the Politecnico di Milano and the Departmental Clubs whose activities focus on specific issues, have the right to ask to send promotional messages to the extra groups of the network linked to them. To be admitted to the list, it is necessary to contact the Head of External Communications. <br>
   This will be followed by:
   <ul>
     <li> Approval of the association (even non-PoliMi) or departmental clubs in the BoD for the single group </li>
     <li> Approval of the message by the admin of the group not part of the organization, in the event of a tie, the approval will be evaluated by majority vote among the guarantors of the Network </li>
   </ul>
   <li> 09. The dissemination of the news of Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano, Club, Departments and Representative Lists is not allowed (except for what is written in this section, subsection 07 and 08).<br/> Publication is allowed in the dedicated system (@PoliAssociazioni, see Section 2),
   In the event that a user independently decides to send news in the group of his reality, that is allowed, given that it is part of the dialogue between peers and it is understandable that a person finds an initiative or information interesting. However, if you see that a message from a reality is shared systematically, immediate action will be taken against the reality in question.<br/>
   People on a Representative List who share a message from it will be downgraded.<br/>
   Using the lists of users of the Network's groups to spam in private without explicit consent is, in addition to unlawful data processing, considered by us on a par with spam in the group itself.<br/>
   <li> 10. Measures<br/>
   For minor infringements it is preferable to write to the person in chat, explaining where he went wrong and asking him not to redo it (by signing the contact according to the current privacy legislation, on telegram there is the possibility of remove the privilege of writing for days). Mild infringements are as follows:
   <ul>
    <li>   Incorrect behavior (Section 1, subsection 4);
    <li>   Internal Spam (Section 1, subsection 3).
    <li>   Mild infringements repeated over time constitute a serious infringement
    </ul>
   For serious infringements, on the other hand, the user must be banned from the whole PoliNetwork (if you have a role in the Network, then we proceed to the downgrading). Serious infringements are:
   <ul>
    <li>   External Spam (Section 1, subsection 1);
    <li>   Spam of Associations Recognized by the Polytechnic of Milan, Departmental Clubs and Representative Lists;
    <li>   Serious offenses to Users.
    </ul>
   With regard to recognized associations, departmental clubs and representative lists: if one breaks the Spam rules will be taken against the whole reality:
       For a first offense, any post privileges in @PoliAssociazoni are revoked;<br>
       At the second offense all the privileges are lost, even of the individual Users or of any Admin (they also lose the right to vote in the Board of Directors), decaying, and all the Admin of that reality are banned for 2 years (banned the entire reality for 2 years, due to violation of the rules, such as the spam of a reality during the pre-election and election campaign period).<br/>
   <li> Recognition process for departmental clubs:
     <ul>
      <li> A departmental club applies for one or more courses
      <li> Requires unanimous approval of student representatives in CCS in each of the courses
      <li> Opinion by majority of the Council
      <li> If the vote is successful the club will have permission to ask the Network to send messages in the course group and its name will be added at rule 1.7 or 1.8.
    </ul>

</ul>
</p>
<h3>
Section 2: SPONSORING
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Advertisment posts are not allowed to prevent spam on our group.

<li> With the sentence above, we mean that no unauthorized spam should appear in the chat or in the group (whether in the name, in the message content, etc.).

<li> We have developed a special system for the associations of the Politecnico, and it is the following: they can publish, by contacting us on our Facebook page, a photo with description regarding their event, in the channel @PoliAssociazioni in Telegram and other social media platforms. From there, together with them, we will discuss which groups make sense to forward their post to. In this way, the channel will grow and become a reference point for the excellent initiatives that the various associations propose.

<li> For any exceptions or in case you are not part of the previously listed categories please contact us with a private message on our facebook page.

</ul>
</p>
<h3>
Section 3: CLEANING CHAT
</h3>
<p>
The administrators will clean the chat silently from any heavy Out Topic, flame and messages against the regulation, in order to ensure the best possible quality for the community, respecting all users.

The cleaning issue is better explained in the CHAT CLEANING EXTENSION (see below)
</p>

<h3>
Section 4: BAN and SECURITY
</h3>
<p>
Users that will not behave correctly and will repeatedly break the poli rules, will be banned from the groups, following the section 1: CONTENT AND MEASURES.
</p>

<h3>
Section 5: ADMIN
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> For information, requests or proposals you can contact the group's admins

<li> To report the presence of trolls and spammers, as well as group users who show inappropriate behaviour towards you in private chat, contact the admins.

<li> The better your conduct in the group will be, the greater the tolerance towards you in case of any mistakes in good faith will be. The ban will always be considered extrema ratio by the admin (except for what written in other sections in this rules)
</ul>
</p>
<h3>
Section 6: LOST&FOUND
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> It's normal to lose something. If you find an object, in addition to bringing it to the appropriate office (you can find it on the Politecnico website), you can report it in your Scaglione's group
</ul>
</p>

<h3 class="plainRules">
Now here are some extra platform-specific rules:
</h3>

<h4>
RULES - TELEGRAM
</h4>

<ul>
<li> You must set an @username, offensive usernames will be judged as a troll

<li> We only want real people in our groups, so users should have their name (and possibly their surname) on Telegram, not just nicknames or others. It is also strongly recommended to have your face in a profile picture.

<li> NO games, for that there is a specific group

<li> Use of GIFs and stickers and the addition of bots to the chat are prohibited
</ul>

<h4>
RULES - WHATSAPP
</h4>

<ul>
<li> We only want real people in our groups, so users should have their name (and possibly their surname) on Whatsapp, not just nicknames or others

<li> You must not change the name or description of the groups.
</ul>
<h4>
RULES - FACEBOOK
</h4>
<ul>

<li> We only want real people in our groups, so users should have their name (and possibly their surname) on Facebook, not just nicknames or others.
</ul>
<h4>
RULES - DISCORD
</h4>
<ul>

<li> Follow the channel's topic: If the chat is called "Games", talk about that
</ul>
<h4>
RULES - REDDIT
</h4>
<ul>

<li> Follow the post's topic: If the post is called "Question about TOL", talk about that

</ul>
<h3>
EXTENSION [CHAT CLEANING]
</h3>
<p>
This is an extension of the @PoliRules<br/>

The cleaning of the chat is a possible operation on Telegram, because the messages deleted in the supergroups are deleted for all at the same time. We also do it on Discord.<br/>

Why is cleaning performed?<br/>

Imagine if a conversation about cats happened during the summer in the group. Maybe many like them, but a person who is preparing for the entrance test would not want to find certain messages while studying. So, what to do? The group is kept clean, that's all. However, there are groups to talk about non-school subjects, you can find them in @PoliExtra. And there, even cats are welcome.<br/>

So do not worry if a message (or more) disappears, it can happen. If you think that your message should not have disappeared, do not write it in the group where it disappeared, write privately to the group administrator and discuss instead.<br/>

This also applies to any discussions like "why did I get a warn?" or similar, they are all things to be discussed privately with the administrator, and if you are sent this kind of messages to the group, they will be removed as well.<br/>
<br />
Thanks, have fun in the @PoliNetwork.
</p>

	<h3>
		DOXING
	</h3>
	<p>
		This is an extension of the @PoliRules<br/>
		The term doxing, or doxxing, refers to the practice of publicly seeking and disseminating personal and private information online (such as name and surname, address, telephone number, etc.) or other sensitive data concerning a person, usually with intent malevolent.
		<br />
		Doxing in the network is prohibited. Each admin reserves the right to evaluate with criteria whether the dissemination of the data of other individuals was in good faith or for a malicious / defamatory purpose. We remind you that in the latter case it is prohibited by the law itself, as confirmed by the Privacy Guarantor <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9694250"> https : //www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9694250 </a>. The admins will, where the platform allows it, regardless of the good faith of the sender, to delete the disseminated data. In the case of malicious conduct, the ban is triggered
	</p>
